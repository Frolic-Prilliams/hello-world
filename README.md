# hello-world

Hi! :)

I'm a long time web dev (first site back in 1996 @ CSU Monterey) who's exploring other kinds or programming and interacting with others in the programming community. I'm new to open source and hoping to build and share my first mobile app soon. I'm excited about the potential of blockchain technologies/systems and a total newb in the area.
